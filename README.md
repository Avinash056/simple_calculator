a simple calculator program in C exemplifies an essential educational tool for aspiring programmers.
By focusing on fundamental arithmetic operations, the program not only reinforces key programming principles but also fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
As learners engage with this project, they lay the groundwork for more advanced programming endeavors, empowering them to navigate the vast landscape of software development with confidence. Through the experience of building a calculator, they cultivate a deeper appreciation for the art of programming and its practical applications in everyday life.
Functionality of the Calculator

The calculator performs four primary operations:

    Addition: This operation combines two numbers, yielding their sum. For example, if the user inputs 5 and 3 with the + operator, the calculator outputs 8.

    Subtraction: This operation finds the difference between two numbers. Using the same inputs as above with the - operator would result in 2.

    Multiplication: By using the * operator, the calculator multiplies the two numbers, which demonstrates the concept of repeated addition.

    Division: The division operation, indicated by the / operator, divides one number by another. The program must handle special cases, such as division by zero, by implementing error checking to prevent runtime errors.
